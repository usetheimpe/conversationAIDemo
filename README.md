🎙️ Voice Dialogue AI Bot with SSML
This project creates an AI-powered voice-based dialogue bot using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) and voice input recognition. The goal is to enable natural, expressive spoken conversations between humans and AI — going beyond text-based chat into voice-first interaction.
